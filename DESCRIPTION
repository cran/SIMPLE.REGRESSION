Description: Provides SPSS- and SAS-like output for least squares multiple 
    regression, logistic regression, and Poisson regression. Detailed output  
    is also provided for OLS moderated regression, interaction plots, and 
    Johnson-Neyman regions of significance. The output includes standardized
    coefficients, partial and semi-partial correlations, collinearity diagnostics,
    plots of residuals, and detailed information about simple slopes for  
    interactions. There are numerous options for model plots,  
    including plots of interactions for both lm and lme models.
