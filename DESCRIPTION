Description: Provides SPSS- and SAS-like output for least squares multiple regression,
    logistic regression, and count variable regressions. Detailed output is also provided for
    OLS moderated regression, interaction plots, and Johnson-Neyman
    regions of significance. The output includes standardized
    coefficients, partial and semi-partial correlations, collinearity diagnostics,
    plots of residuals, and detailed information about simple slopes for interactions. 
    The output for some functions includes Bayes Factors and, if requested,  
    regression coefficients from Bayesian Markov Chain Monte Carlo analyses.
    There are numerous options for model plots.
    The REGIONS_OF_SIGNIFICANCE function also provides
    Johnson-Neyman regions of significance and plots of interactions for both lm
    and lme models.
